- Always use context7 when I need code generation, setup or configuration steps, or
  library/API documentation. This means you should automatically use the Context7 MCP
  tools to resolve library id and get library docs without me having to explicitly ask.
- Always end every reply with a list of what MCP servers were used (if any)
